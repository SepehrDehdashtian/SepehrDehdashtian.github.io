Hi there! I'm Sepehr, currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Michigan State University, with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My primary focus is on ensuring fairness in machine learning models, including mitigating bias in CLIP models, exploring utility versus fairness trade-offs in datasets, and auditing models and datasets for bias. I'm also delving into the fundamentals of bias and fairness in generative AI to contribute to the development of more equitable AI systems.

If you're interested in discussing my research or anything else, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:sepehr@msu.edu) or connect with me on social media. You can find more about me and my work on this website and [my CV](https://sepehrdehdashtian.github.io/assets/pdf/CV-SepehrDehdashtian.pdf). Additionally, I am actively seeking research internship opportunities and would love to hear from you. Looking forward to connecting!
