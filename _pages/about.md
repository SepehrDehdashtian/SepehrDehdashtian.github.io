Hi there! I'm Sepehr, currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Michigan State University, with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My work centers on **reliability** and **representation learning** in **multimodal** and **generative models**, as well as on understanding and mitigating bias and fairness issues in generative AI systems. I have investigated **stereotype detection** and **steerability** in diffusion and flow-matching text-to-image models, and I am currently exploring post-training policy enforcement for foundation models, applying both RL-based (e.g., RLHF) and non-RL (e.g., DPO) methods. Through these efforts, I aim to identify and address failure modes where models deviate from safety and alignment policies, ultimately contributing to more equitable and trustworthy AI systems.

If you're interested in discussing my research or anything else, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:sepehr@msu.edu) or connect with me on social media. You can find more about my work on this website and in [my CV](https://sepehrdehdashtian.github.io/assets/pdf/CV-SepehrDehdashtian.pdf). 

**<span style="color: red;">I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for summer 2025 and would love to hear from you. Looking forward to connecting!</span>**
